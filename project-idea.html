								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>Beauâ€™s project idea is a new tailored solution for identity management after you or your loved one has deceased. IMaaS (Identity Management as a Service) would usher about a new era to ensure that loved ones can choose to either delete your entire internet profile or retain and manage under their request. Additionally, this service would reduce the emotional toll searching for multiple social media accounts linked to the deceased.</p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>At a minimum, 300 million new social media accounts are created every year. One of the most difficult times for loved ones, is managing the deceased affairs, ranging from estates to their online digital footprint.  Whilst taking into consideration that the average person has 7 social media accounts, it can be quite degrading and upsetting for friends and family of the recently deceased trying to either delete or manage their social media accounts. With the project idea I propose, the idea would have one account linked to all social media, in which a deceased persons affair can be managed centrally rather than individual accounts.</p>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>The project functionality is to create a profile on our website portal, which users can associate all their social media logins (either from OAuth or having their credentials stored in plain text). This data would be only available to those who have an authenticated login for that session data. Security being one of our biggest concerns would be enforced using MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). This will require users to have either a mobile app like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, MFA to Text Service (Which users will need to register their Mobile Phone) or authentication via email. The website portal itself does create its own sense of irony, creating an additional social media platform to manage other social media platforms. The</p>

								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If this project is successful, families would be able to manage the deceased social media accounts more seamlessly without having to fight for access to these accounts with the social media provider. I do find it unlikely that such a service like this would ever likely be successfully implemented due to its controversial and difficult nature, however, I do believe that the intent behind the service is justified and were to be used in good will.</p>
